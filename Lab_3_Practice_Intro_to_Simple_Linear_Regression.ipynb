The SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) and ACT (American College Testing) are the most common entrance exams used by U.S. universities and colleges when making admission decisions.

In what follows, we will study the relationship of both SAT scores and high school GPA with first year GPA at university/college. \n",

The maximum percentile on each component would be 100, making 200 the maximum total of the verbal and math percentiles.**"
