The SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) and ACT (American College Testing) are the most common entrance exams used by U.S. universities and colleges when making admission decisions. Considerable research has been undertaken into the ability of these standardized tests and high school grades to predict success at university. In what follows, we will study the relationship of both SAT scores and high school GPA with first year GPA at university/college. \n",

The maximum percentile on each component would be 100, making 200 the maximum total of the verabl and math percentiles.**"

That object contains a large amount of information, including the residuals, or prediction errors, associated with each observation. Therefore, `residuals` is a variable that may be found in the object `regress1`. To access the residuals we would use `regress1$residuals`. We will use the `abline` function to add a horizontal line at 0 to the plot."
