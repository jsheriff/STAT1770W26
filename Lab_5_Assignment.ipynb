    "Resumes were sent out to 316 top law firms in the United States. Each law firm represents an observational unit, or subject, in this study. There were two randomized characteristics of each resume. First, the gender associated with the resume was randomized by assigning a first name of either James or Julia. Second, the socioeconomic class of the candidate was randomly assigned and represented through five minor changes associated with personal interests and other other minor details (e.g. an extracurricular activity of sailing team vs track and field). The outcome variable was whether the candidate received an interview.\n",
